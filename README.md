# Microservice-grpc-Project
# Project Overview:

This project entails the development of a Microservice API Gateway using the Golang programming language, leveraging the Gin framework for HTTP routing and gRPC for inter-service communication. The API Gateway acts as a central entry point for client applications to interact with various backend services within the system. It facilitates authentication, authorization, rate limiting, request validation, load balancing, and fault tolerance, thereby ensuring efficient and secure communication between clients and backend services.
